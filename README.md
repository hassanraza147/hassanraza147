👋 Hi, I’m @hassanraza147  
👀 I’m interested in interdisciplinary research, data-driven analysis, and academic writing, with a particular focus on subjects such as chemistry, microbiology, environmental science, medical science, law, and management. My work blends technical proficiency with clear, impactful communication, and I’m committed to advancing research that addresses real-world challenges.  

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in analytical chemistry, including gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and various spectroscopic methods, which enhance my ability to conduct precise and high-quality research. Alongside my technical skills, I am delving deeper into Python and other data analysis tools to streamline and elevate my research outcomes.  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve innovative scientific research, data interpretation, and academic content development, especially in STEM fields. I welcome opportunities to work with international research teams to explore solutions in environmental sustainability, health sciences, and advanced material science.
